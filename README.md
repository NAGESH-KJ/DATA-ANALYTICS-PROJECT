# DATA-ANALYTICS-PROJECT
CRIME DATA ANALYSIS
As preprocessing part of the dataset , we have implemented Dimensionality Reduction. We have dropped certain columns since someof them are not useful for analysis and some are redundant. ID and city are useless variables.Month and hour are redundant variables since the can be derived from date and time columns respectively.

We have also included certain graphs as a part of data visualization. R , Rmd and html files for the same is uploaded. We have used to types of plots i.e, bar chart and pie chart for visualization.
